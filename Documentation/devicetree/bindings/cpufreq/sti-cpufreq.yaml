description: |

  ST's CPUFreq driver attempts to read 'process' and 'version' attributes from
  the SoC, then supplies the OPP framework with 'prop' and 'supported hardware'
  information respectively.  The framework is then able to read the DT and
  operate in the usual way.

      For thermal sensors for which no interrupt has been defined, a polling
      delay of 1000ms will be used to read the temperature from device.
